# C++ Music Visualizer (Raylib)

![Music Visualizer Preview](music_visualiser.gif)

This is a simple music visualizer written in **C++**, using the **Raylib** graphics library.  
The project is still in early development (v1 not yet complete), and is currently paused indefinitely until I have more time to work on it.

Check the `dev branch` for the project files.
